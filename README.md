## **Varigraph: an accurate and widely applicable pangenome graph-based variant genotyper for diploid and polyploid genomes**

Welcome to the page that provides comprehensive details on the code utilized by the genome graph software featured in the varigraph article. In this article, we have tested eight commonly used software which include [VG-MAP][VG_url], [VG-Giraffe][VG_url], [GraphAligner][GraphAligner_url], [Paragraph][Paragraph_url], [BayesTyper][BayesTyper_url], [GraphTyper2][GraphTyper2_url] and [PanGenie][PanGenie_url].
